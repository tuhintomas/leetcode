Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will
return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.

Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.

Note:
You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.

canConstruct("a", "b") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "ab") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "aab") -> true

class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        magazine_char=[x for x in magazine]
        ransomNote_char=[x for x in ransomNote]
        for x in ransomNote:
            if x not in magazine_char:
                return False
            else:
                magazine_char.remove(x)
        return True
