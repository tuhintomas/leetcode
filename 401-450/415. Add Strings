Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2.

Note:

The length of both num1 and num2 is < 5100.
Both num1 and num2 contains only digits 0-9.
Both num1 and num2 does not contain any leading zero.
You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

class Solution:
    def addStrings(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        num1=int(num1)
        num2=int(num2)
        res=num1+num2
        return str(res)
